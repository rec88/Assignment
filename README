LRGparser.py

A set of tools to parse an LRG file and produce a bed file of the exonic sequences, a csv file of the annotation for the gene and any sequence differences between GRC37 and GRC38.

For more details about file formats have a look at our wiki, or our example output files.

Created: 14 December 2016

Tested on python versions 3.5.2 and 2.7.8
This script will run with python versions 3.5 and 2.7

Please contact for help and requests, we'll do what we can however this script is no longer under active development.

Usage: python LRGparser.py -g [LRG file name] -d [True/False] -i [True/False] -s [url/file]

Required parameters:
-g, --gene    [name of LRG file without .xml suffix]

Optional parameters:
-h, --help shows this message and quits
-d, --diff, --difference = [True/False] triggers or supresses the output of [LRG]_diffs.csv
-a, --annotations = [True/False] triggers or suppresses [LRG]_annotation.csv
-s, --source = [url/file] default is from file. Adding -s url will trigger LRGparser.py grab the xml from http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex 

Output:
[LRG]_t1.bed: a tab separated bed file containing the chromosome number, exon start position, exon end position.
[LRG]_diffs.csv: a csv file containing the differences between 37 and 38;  -d False will suppress this.
[LRG]_annotation.csv: a csv file of gene information including synonyms, lsdb, long gene name. ;  -i False will suppress this.
