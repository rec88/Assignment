LRGparser.py

a tools to parse an LRG file and produce a bed file of the exonic sequences, a csv file of the annotation for the gene and any sequence differences between GRC37 and GRC38

created: November 2016

Tested on python versions 3.5.2 and 2.7.8
This script will run with python versions 3.5 and 2.7 

@authors: Laura Carreto, Rosie Coates-Brown

please contact for help and requests, we'll do what we can however this script is no longer under active development

usage: python LRGparser.py -g [LRG file name] -d [True/False] -i [True/False]

required parameters:
-g, --gene    [name of LRG file without .xml suffix]

optional parameters:
-h, --help shows this message and quits
-d, --diff, --difference = [True/False] triggers or supresses the output of [LRG]_diffs.csv
-a, --annotations = [True/False] triggers or suppresses [LRG]_annotation.csv
-s, --source = [url/file] default is from file. Adding -s url will trigger LRGparser.py grab the xml from http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/lrgex 

output:
[LRG]_t1.bed: a tab separated bed file containing the chromosome number, exon start position, exon end position  
[LRG]_diffs.csv: a csv file containing the differences between 37 and 38, False will suppress this
[LRG]_annotation.csv: a csv file of gene information including synonyms, lsdb, long gene name
